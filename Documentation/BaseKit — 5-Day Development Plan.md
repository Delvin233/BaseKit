#  BaseKit â€” 5-Day Development Plan

###  Project Overview

**BaseKit** is a multi-engine Web3 gaming SDK that allows developers to add **wallet login and Base Name identity** directly into their games. **Currently optimized for Godot Engine** with plans to expand to Unity, Unreal Engine, and other popular game engines.  
It enables "Sign in with Base" functionality using **Base Names**, making Web3 access seamless for both players and developers.

---

##  Development Timeline (Extended Sprint)

### **Day 1 â€” Project Setup & Basic UI**

- [ ] Set up Godot project structure (GDScript)
- [ ] Create basic UI scenes and layouts
- [ ] Design "Connect Wallet" button and styling
- [ ] Test basic `HTTPRequest` node functionality
- [ ] Create mock wallet address display
- [ ] Set up project folders and initial scripts

**Goal:** Clean project structure with working UI foundation.

**Deliverable:** Godot project with clickable UI that shows mock data.

---

### **Day 2 â€” RPC Connection & Wallet Logic**

- [ ] Implement Base RPC calls using `HTTPRequest`
- [ ] Handle JSON responses and error cases
- [ ] Create wallet address validation
- [ ] **Fallback:** Mock wallet connection if RPC issues
- [ ] Log all network activity for debugging
- [ ] Test with multiple RPC endpoints

**Goal:** Reliable connection to Base network with proper error handling.

**Backup Plan:** Use hardcoded test addresses if network issues persist.

---

### **Day 3 â€” Base Name Resolution**

- [ ] Research ENS resolution on Base network
- [ ] Implement Base Name lookup functionality
- [ ] Handle reverse resolution (address â†’ name)
- [ ] Add avatar metadata fetching
- [ ] Create fallback for addresses without Base Names
- [ ] Cache resolution results locally

**Goal:** Convert wallet addresses to human-readable Base Names.

**Test Data:** Use known addresses with confirmed Base Names.

---

### **Day 4 â€” Game Development Day! ðŸŽ®**

**Joint Task - Build Coin Adventure Game Together**

**Morning: Game Design (2-3 hours)**

- [ ] Study platformer game mechanics (jump, collect coins, platforms)
- [ ] Plan BaseKit integration (show Base Name as player name)
- [ ] Design sprites (knight character, coins, platforms, enemies)
- [ ] Set up game scene structure in examples/ folder

**Afternoon: Game Implementation (4-5 hours)**

- [ ] Create player character with jump and movement physics
- [ ] Add platform collision and coin collection mechanics
- [ ] Implement enemy AI and collision detection
- [ ] Add scoring system tied to Base Name
- [ ] Integrate BaseKit login for score display

**BaseKit Integration:**

- Show Base Name in high score display
- "Sign in with Base" to save scores
- Display avatar next to player name
- Leaderboard with Base Names instead of "Anonymous"

**Goal:** Playable Coin Adventure game with Web3 identity integration.

---

### **Day 5 â€” Polish, Testing & Documentation**

**Joint Task**

**Morning: Integration & Polish**

- [ ] Combine all BaseKit components
- [ ] Add session persistence and error handling
- [ ] Polish game UI and BaseKit integration
- [ ] Test full flow: login â†’ play â†’ persist

**Afternoon: Documentation & Demo**

- [ ] Write clear README with setup instructions
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Record 60-second demo video
- [ ] Package SDK for distribution
- [ ] Test on different devices/platforms

**Goal:** Complete, documented SDK with impressive game demo.

##  Game Development Learning Path

### **Godot Basics (Day 4 Morning)**

- Scenes and nodes structure
- GDScript fundamentals
- Input handling
- Basic physics and movement

### **Game Integration Ideas**

```gdscript
# Example: Show Base Name in game UI
func _ready():
    if BaseKit.is_connected():
        player_name_label.text = BaseKit.get_base_name()
        avatar_texture.texture = BaseKit.get_avatar()
```

### **Coin Adventure Game Mechanics**

**Core Gameplay:**

- Player controls a knight character on platforms
- Player uses arrow keys to move and space to jump
- Score increases by collecting coins scattered on platforms
- Avoid slime enemies that patrol platforms
- Platformer-style physics with gravity and jumping

**BaseKit Integration:**

```gdscript
# Show Base Name in UI
func update_player_display():
    if BaseKit.is_connected():
        player_label.text = BaseKit.get_base_name()
        high_score_label.text = "Best: " + str(get_high_score())
    else:
        player_label.text = "Anonymous Player"
```

**Game Features:**

- **Main Menu:** "Sign in with Base" button
- **Game Over:** Show current score + Base Name
- **High Scores:** Leaderboard with Base Names
- **Simple Graphics:** Colorful pixel art style

##  Risk Mitigation

| Day | Risk                       | Solution                          |
| --- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1   | Godot setup issues         | Use online Godot editor as backup |
| 2   | RPC connection fails       | Switch to mock data immediately   |
| 3   | ENS resolution complex     | Use hardcoded test mappings       |
| 4   | Game mechanics too complex | Focus on jump + collision only    |
| 5   | Integration breaks         | Focus on documentation over fixes |
