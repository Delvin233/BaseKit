# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BaseKit is a comprehensive Web3 identity SDK for Godot games that enables seamless wallet authentication and Base Name resolution. The SDK transforms complex blockchain interactions into simple, developer-friendly APIs, allowing game developers to integrate Web3 identity features without requiring deep blockchain expertise. The system leverages Base Names (ENS on Base network) to provide human-readable identities for players, dramatically improving user experience by displaying memorable names like "player.base.eth" instead of cryptic wallet addresses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to integrate wallet authentication into my Godot game with minimal code, so that I can add Web3 features without learning complex blockchain protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer adds BaseKit to their Godot project THEN they SHALL be able to enable wallet connection with a single button component
2. WHEN a developer calls BaseKit.connect_wallet() THEN the system SHALL initiate browser-based OAuth authentication flow
3. WHEN wallet authentication completes THEN the system SHALL emit a wallet_connected signal with the user's address
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL emit a connection_error signal with descriptive error message
5. IF the developer has not configured BaseKit properly THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating missing configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game player, I want to see my Base Name instead of my wallet address in games, so that my identity is recognizable and memorable to other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wallet is successfully connected THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve the wallet address to a Base Name
2. WHEN Base Name resolution succeeds THEN the system SHALL emit a basename_resolved signal with both address and resolved name
3. WHEN Base Name resolution fails THEN the system SHALL display a formatted version of the wallet address (first 6 + "..." + last 4 characters)
4. WHEN multiple resolution requests are made for the same address THEN the system SHALL return cached results to improve performance
5. IF the address has no associated Base Name THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to formatted address display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game player, I want my avatar to be displayed alongside my Base Name, so that I have a complete visual identity in Web3 games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Base Name resolution succeeds THEN the system SHALL query ENS records for avatar metadata
2. WHEN avatar URL is found THEN the system SHALL download and cache the avatar image from IPFS
3. WHEN avatar loading completes THEN the system SHALL emit an avatar_loaded signal with the texture
4. WHEN avatar loading fails THEN the system SHALL use a default avatar image
5. IF avatar URL is not available THEN the system SHALL display default avatar without error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game player, I want my login session to persist across game restarts, so that I don't have to reconnect my wallet every time I play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallet connection succeeds THEN the system SHALL save session data to local storage
2. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore previous session automatically
3. WHEN session is valid and not expired THEN the system SHALL restore connection state and emit wallet_connected signal
4. WHEN session is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL clear session data and require new authentication
5. IF session file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and start fresh authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want pre-built UI components for wallet connection, so that I can quickly prototype Web3 features without designing custom interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer instantiates BaseKitButton THEN it SHALL display a styled "Connect Wallet" button
2. WHEN BaseKitButton is clicked THEN it SHALL trigger the wallet connection flow automatically
3. WHEN connection state changes THEN BaseKitButton SHALL update its appearance and text accordingly
4. WHEN developer instantiates UserModal THEN it SHALL display user profile with Base Name and avatar
5. IF user is not connected THEN UI components SHALL show appropriate disconnected state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot integration issues and provide good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any network request fails THEN the system SHALL emit appropriate error signals with descriptive messages
2. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about all operations
3. WHEN RPC endpoints are unreachable THEN the system SHALL attempt fallback endpoints automatically
4. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to fix the issue
5. IF critical components fail to initialize THEN the system SHALL prevent crashes and log error details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the SDK to work across different platforms (desktop, web, mobile), so that I can deploy my Web3 game to multiple targets without platform-specific code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game is exported to web platform THEN BaseKit SHALL function correctly in browser environment
2. WHEN game is exported to desktop THEN BaseKit SHALL open system browser for OAuth authentication
3. WHEN network requests are made THEN they SHALL use HTTPS and handle CORS appropriately
4. WHEN session data is saved THEN it SHALL use platform-appropriate storage locations
5. IF platform-specific features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to integrate BaseKit into my existing game architecture, so that Web3 features complement rather than disrupt my current game design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BaseKit is added to a project THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing game systems
2. WHEN BaseKit signals are emitted THEN they SHALL integrate cleanly with existing signal-based architectures
3. WHEN BaseKit components are instantiated THEN they SHALL follow Godot best practices for memory management
4. WHEN game scenes are changed THEN BaseKit state SHALL persist appropriately across scene transitions
5. IF BaseKit is disabled or removed THEN the game SHALL continue to function without Web3 features

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to integrate BaseKit effectively and follow best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer accesses BaseKit documentation THEN they SHALL find comprehensive API reference with all methods and signals
2. WHEN developer needs integration examples THEN they SHALL find working code samples for common use cases
3. WHEN developer encounters issues THEN they SHALL find troubleshooting guides with common problems and solutions
4. WHEN developer wants to customize BaseKit THEN they SHALL find clear guidance on configuration options
5. IF developer needs advanced features THEN they SHALL find examples of complex integration patterns

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want BaseKit to handle Base network specifics automatically, so that I can focus on game development rather than blockchain infrastructure details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BaseKit initializes THEN it SHALL automatically configure Base network RPC endpoints
2. WHEN ENS resolution is performed THEN it SHALL use Base-specific ENS registry and resolver contracts
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN it SHALL automatically retry with backup RPC endpoints
4. WHEN chain ID validation is needed THEN it SHALL verify connection to Base network (chain ID 8453)
5. IF Base network is unavailable THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback about network connectivity issues
